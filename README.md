# Structured_matrix_computation
I plan to put some basic codes for implementing some structured matrix computations, such as 

(1) Toeplitz matrix-vector product;

(2) Circulant preconditioning;

(3) Two-and-two form of matrix;

(4) Matrix with SSS structure;

(5) Matrix with HSS structure;

(6) Multilevel Toeplitz matrices;

(7) Matrix with displacement structure;

(8) .................
